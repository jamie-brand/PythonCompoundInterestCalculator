# Python Compound Interest Calculator

This project uses Python to calculate compound interest for the user. The user inputs the original investment amount, the interest rate, the length of the investment in years, and the number of times the interest is compounded per year. The program then computes the total balance of the account at the end of the investment period and the amount of interest earned. Lastly, the program outputs a summary of the original investment information (values input by the user), as well as the computed values. 

Program created with Python 3.11.4.
